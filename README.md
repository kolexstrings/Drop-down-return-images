# Drop-down-return-images

The purpose of this repo was to practice for my upcoming project 
the goal that i set to achieve in the project was to great a drop-down button and return each image selected, while having a default image when nothing is selected yet. 
i was able to achieve that with the use of the EventHandler method in javascript using the "onchange" property.
